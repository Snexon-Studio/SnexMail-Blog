Snexon Web Mail is designed to be the simplest and most effective temporary email service available. Whether you're a first-time user or looking to explore advanced features, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to make the most of our service.

## Getting Started with Snexon Web Mail

Using Snexon Web Mail requires no registration or setup. Simply visit our website at www.snxmail.fun, and you'll have immediate access to all our features.

### Generating Your First Temporary Email

1. **Visit the Website**: Go to www.snxmail.fun
2. **Choose Generation Mode**: Select from Standard, Dynamic, or Realistic modes
3. **Select Domain**: Choose from our available domains
4. **Click Generate**: Your temporary email address is created instantly

That's it! Your temporary email address is ready to use immediately.

## Understanding Generation Modes

Snexon Web Mail offers three distinct generation modes to suit different needs:

### Standard Mode
Standard mode gives you complete control over your email address creation. This is the most straightforward mode where you specify both your username and domain.

**How to use**:
1. Select "Standard" mode
2. Enter your desired username in the input field
3. Choose your preferred domain from the dropdown
4. Click "Generate"

**Best for**:
- Services that require more "legitimate" looking emails
- Situations where you might need to remember the address
- Professional temporary communications

### Dynamic Mode
Dynamic mode is our intelligent selection mode. It randomly selects from our official domains and, if you're logged in and have added custom domains to your account, it will also include your personal domains in the random selection process.

**How it works**:
1. The system first checks if you have any custom domains added to your account
2. If custom domains are found, they're included in the random selection pool
3. If no custom domains are found, it uses our official domains
4. Both official domains (temp.snxmail.fun, box.bdtn.one, inbox.snexon.shop) and your custom domains are randomly selected

**Best for**:
- Users with custom domains who want variety
- Advanced users who want maximum flexibility
- Situations where domain variety is important

### Realistic Mode
Realistic mode generates email addresses with usernames that appear more authentic and human-like. This mode is particularly useful when dealing with services that have strict validation rules.

**How it works**:
1. Select "Realistic" mode
2. The system generates a realistic username
3. Domains are automatically selected from our available pool
4. Authentication may be required for this mode to prevent abuse

**Best for**:
- Services with strict validation rules
- Situations requiring more authentic-looking email addresses
- Advanced users who need higher acceptance rates

## Domain Selection

Snexon Web Mail provides multiple domain options for your temporary email addresses:

### Official Domains
- **temp.snxmail.fun**: Our primary domain
- **box.bdtn.one**: Alternative official domain
- **inbox.snexon.shop**: Additional official domain

### Custom Domains
If you've added custom domains to your account, they'll be available in the domain selection dropdown. Users can add unlimited custom domains to their accounts.
