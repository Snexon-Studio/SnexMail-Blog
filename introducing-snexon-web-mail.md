Welcome to Snexon Web Mail, the revolutionary temporary email service designed for the modern internet user who values privacy, convenience, and security. In a digital landscape where personal information is constantly at risk, we've created a solution that empowers you to take control of your online privacy without compromising on usability.

## What is Snexon Web Mail?

Snexon Web Mail is a cutting-edge temporary email service that generates disposable email addresses instantly, with no registration required. Whether you're signing up for a new service, making an online purchase, or simply want to protect your personal email address, Snexon Web Mail provides the perfect solution.

Unlike traditional email services that require lengthy sign-up processes and personal information, our platform offers immediate access to temporary email addresses that expire automatically after one hour. This "set it and forget it" approach ensures your privacy is maintained without any ongoing management on your part.

## Understanding Our Three Generation Modes

Snexon Web Mail offers three distinct generation modes to suit different needs and preferences. Each mode provides unique benefits for specific use cases.

### Standard Mode
In Standard mode, you have complete control over both your username and domain selection. This mode is perfect when you want a memorable email address or need to appear more legitimate to certain services.

**How it works:**
- You specify your preferred username
- You select from available domains
- Your email address is created instantly

**Best for:**
- Services that validate email domains
- Situations where you might need to remember the address
- Professional temporary communications

### Dynamic Mode
Dynamic mode is our most intelligent option. It automatically selects from our official domains (temp.snxmail.fun, box.bdtn.one, inbox.snexon.shop) and, if you're logged in and have added custom domains to your account, it will also include your personal domains in the random selection process.

**How it works:**
- The system checks if you have any custom domains added to your account
- If custom domains are found, they're included in the random selection pool
- If no custom domains are found, it uses our official domains
- Both official domains and your custom domains are randomly selected

**Best for:**
- Users with custom domains who want variety
- Advanced users who want maximum flexibility
- Situations where domain variety is important

### Realistic Mode
Realistic mode generates email addresses with usernames that appear more authentic and human-like. This mode is particularly useful when dealing with services that have strict validation rules or when you want your temporary email to appear more legitimate.

**How it works:**
- The system generates realistic usernames that resemble real email addresses
- Domains are automatically selected from our available pool
- Authentication may be required for this mode to prevent abuse

**Best for:**
- Services with strict validation rules
- Situations requiring more authentic-looking email addresses
- Advanced users who need higher acceptance rates
